## Captain's Log: Stardate 2579.8

Hey there, recruit! Captain Alex "Stardust" Chen here. Welcome aboard the Cosmic Defender. Grab your flight suit and strap in—things are about to get messy out there.

## The Mission

Listen up! The Voraxian swarm has breached the outer rim defense systems. These space bugs have been munching their way through our outposts for months, and now they're heading straight for Earth. You've been handpicked to pilot our last line of defense: the X-7 Starfire fighter.

Your job is simple: blast every alien that moves. Don't let them reach our home planet. I've lost too many good pilots already—don't make me add your name to that list.

## Flight Controls

```
W or UP ARROW    - Thrust forward
S or DOWN ARROW  - Reverse thrusters
A or LEFT ARROW  - Roll port (left)
D or RIGHT ARROW - Roll starboard (right)

ESC              - Emergency abort (quit mission)
```

## The Story So Far

I still remember the day they showed up—the day the sky turned red.

I was piloting a routine cargo run from Europa when my sensors lit up like a Martian nightclub. The Voraxians just... appeared. No warning, no declarations. Just destruction. They tore through Jupiter's defense fleet in minutes.

We've been fighting back for three years now. Lost the outer colonies. Lost Mars. Lost the Moon. But we still have Earth, and as long as we have pilots like you, we've got a fighting chance.

The X-7 Starfire is humanity's best tech—quick, nimble, and packing enough firepower to make a difference. Each ship costs more than a small continent to build, so try not to crash it on your first run, okay?

The Voraxians come in three types:

- Small scouts: Fast but fragile. Don't let their numbers overwhelm you.
- Medium fighters: These pack a punch. Take them out quickly.
- Large destroyers: Heavily armored. Focus your fire and keep moving.

Remember: your shields regenerate, but they need time. If you're taking heavy fire, pull back and regroup.

Good luck out there, pilot. Earth is counting on you.
